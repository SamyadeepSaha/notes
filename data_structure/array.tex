\section{Array}
Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored
at contiguous memory location. It is one of the most popular and simple
data structures used in programming.
\textbf{Basic terminologies of Array}
\begin{itemize}
\item Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their
indexes. Array index starts from 0.
\item Array Element: Elements are items stored in an array and can be
accessed by their index.
\item Array Length: The length of an array is determined by the number
of elements it can contain.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Memory representation of Array}
In an array, all the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
So, if we intitialize an array, of elements.
\textbf{Purpose of arrays}
Assume there is a class of five students and if we have to keep records
of their marks and examination then, we can do this by declaring five
variables individual and keeping track of records but what if the number
of students becomes very large, it would be challenging to manipulate
and maintain the data.

What it means is that, we can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3,...)
when we have a small number of objects. But if we want to store a large
number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal
variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one
variable.
